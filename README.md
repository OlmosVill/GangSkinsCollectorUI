# Hi, I'm Alex! üëã

 This is part of my project [Gang Skins](https://twitter.com/), 
 the function of this little desktop app is only to read your skins inventory from  League of Legends Client and send this collection to the database, and can do this with League of Legends Client API (LCU).

 If you want to know more about LCU, you can visit [Hextexh Docs](https://hextechdocs.dev/getting-started-with-the-lcu-api/).

 About the GangSkins Database, I only get your skins information and summoner name, then I get this, the information is saved in the database so when you and your friends want to use GangSkins Web, can do it any time without having to run GangSkinsCollector.
 
 üë©‚Äçüíª Actually I'm currently working on some way to do this without having to save your skins collection but have SkinsCollector on, to skip to save your skins, but I need time. 

 For transparency, I decided to leave you a string connection to a Mongo database for you can't see the info too. 

 ```bash
   mongodb+srv://TransparentUser:YouCanSeeYourInfoToo@almosttesting.bz8a5nn.mongodb.net/
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Execute  GanksSkinsCollector.exe

3Ô∏è‚É£ Press "Share my skins"
